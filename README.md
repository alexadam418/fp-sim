# fp-sim

fp_sim.f90 is not dependent on any other modules to run, however the programmes that use it that produce graphical outputs were made with the Fortran modules RSutil and RSplot which were created by Roland Schilling. I have therefore included the executable files for these programmes so that they can be run.
